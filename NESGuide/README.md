## NESGuide
This directory was based on https://github.com/InkboxSoftware/NESGuide, and this README is a
modified version of the original one, .bat file was translated to Makefile syntax as `make original`
while my modified version can be compiled with `make own`

This repository is related to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5uWqdK92i0), a 
tutorial for how to program the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Family Computer 
(Famicom). The final assembly file is given as an example of what a basic starter program 
should look like.

To compile this program, please download [CC65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65)

Then run the following commands:
```
make all
```

The result will be one or more .NES files which can then be ran using an NES Emulator.
